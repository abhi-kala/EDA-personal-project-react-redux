# Personal project

1. ```npm install```
2. ```npm start ```<br/>

The project is a basic app that I made to understand React/Redux workflow. It has a working basic realtime search.

---
### Objectives I had initially set :innocent:
---
  * Understand the react redux workflow
  * Achieve a clear understanding of
    * State
    * Reducers
    * Actions
  * Understand the use of Router
  * Setup a fully functional small app using react and redux with a functional backend

##### Project has various branches, two main branches are:
  * Master - ```git checkout master```
    * navigation done via state
  * react-router - ```git checkout react-router```
    * Main navigation done via react-router

### Mind bending crisis :scream:
---
When I was setting up my initial objectives I had no idea about React and Redux workflow, the only thing I knew was that we will be learning it and I wanted to use it.<br/>

I started with an idea to build a small react app with the frontend and the backend connected and working(basic CRUD operations). All seemed good as I created a database using knex and started working on the API. <br/>

During the same time we started learning React and Redux.
After going through a couple of sessions of React and Redux I felt that I did not understand it fully and reworked my personal projects scope so that I could really get a hang of this wild horse called "React & Redux", it was not going to scare me .... No No Nooooo . I was going to get it !

---
### Time to tame the horse :facepunch:
---
Brand new narrow focus:
* Have a super clear understanding of :
  * **state**
  * **reducers**
  * **actions**


I took the basic widget example that Don had demonstrated in the class and started working with it. I did the whole example 3 times to make sure that I understood the React-Redux Application workflow. I did it till I could create the modules needed, write actions and reducers without any help and debug it myself. Of course I asked Don tons of times for help but by the third time I felt I had tamed the horse and I created this simple app to confirm my understanding.

### Project Stats :thumbsup:
---
Time Taken:
  * 6 hrs
    * I spent a whole lot of time on the weekend toying with React and Redux and I must say that toying around with functional programming also helped me a lot.

Bottlenecks:
  * Took me a little while to get the search function to work, but now that I have done it once it feels like I can do it way faster next time. Although nothing gets simpler and faster with programming, next time I will attempt somthing more complex and take the same amount of time :smiley:

### Next Steps :dart:
